Riddle me this, he wrote down.

Besides a massive headache that every so often accompanied him, Salvador was
feeling ambitious. His recent energies had led him to extending his greedy
tendrils toward the world of fiction. This current undertaking was informed by
his success in other intellectual arenas. He figured his talking of much more
difficult and rigorous activities had prepared him for future wins in whatever
his viscious little heart desired.

He would write; this much he knew. Riding the spiritual experience he exacted
from reading Borges, he decided he would write fiction that writes back.
