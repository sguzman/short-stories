* Introduction
I, Salvador Guzm\'{a}n, ravenously consumed the blinking cursor.

It had been a while since my thoughts steered towards the world creative of
writing. What usually dominated my day-to-day devices pulled my sinewy spirit
away from that realm human activity. I was too busy scaffolding original
intellectual activity in mathematics to trifle with such small game.

I knew in my heart that my contributions to mathematics would outlive me and my
living years would be a simple prelude to my immortality. And any minute I spend
doing anything other than studying mathematics was a wanton squander of my
genius. Posterity would never forgive me for any chance waste of my innate
talent.

Thus, forgive me dear idle reader when I venture a modest intimation and
emphatically state my intellectual superiority over you. It's why you're here in
the first place.

And as these humble thoughts swirled around my head and I addressed my legion of
future readers, I blinked my tired eyes. The cursor blinked back.
